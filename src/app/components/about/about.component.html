                Hi my name is Mohamed but you already knew that. I'm currently
                still a student trying to navigate my way through this maze that
                is web development. I started developing at an early age just
                because it was fun. I liked how you can control the elements in
                the web page and make them behave in different ways. I wasn't
                planned at persuing this as a profession, it was a mere hobby.
                But life turns around and here we are ready to rock n roll.
              </p>
